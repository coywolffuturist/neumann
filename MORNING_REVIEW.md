# Morning review — `feature/router` branch

**Built overnight, 2026-04-29.** Everything below is on the local branch `feature/router`. Nothing has been pushed. Test it, then tell me whether to push or revise.

## What's in the branch

A new `neumann/router/` subpackage that takes Neumann's symbolic-routing pattern and applies it to **persona selection** for AI agent systems (Fusion / Pi). The split is the same: LLM generates (planner), Neumann routes (deterministic dispatch).

49 tests pass:

```sh
cd /tmp/neumann
python3 -m pytest tests/router/ -v
# ============================== 49 passed in 0.06s ==============================
```

## Quick demo

```sh
$ python3 -m neumann.router.cli classify-shape "Fix the typo in the README"
shape: single-task  (priority 99, sentences=1)

$ python3 -m neumann.router.cli classify-shape "Build the whole signup flow with verification and onboarding"
shape: mission  (priority 1, sentences=0)
note:  Explicit multi-piece intent — 'build the whole signup flow', …

$ python3 -m neumann.router.cli task "Add /api/healthz endpoint returning {ok:true}"
task 1: Add /api/healthz endpoint returning {ok:true}
  → persona:  backend-engineer
  → type:     backend
  → trace:
      task_type=backend
      context.project_type=*
      matched dispatch row priority=1 → backend-engineer
      validation: ok
```

## What it does NOT do yet (intentional)

1. **No real LLM planner.** Default `MockPlanner` produces a single-task plan derived from the raw prompt. Real Claude/Sonnet planner integration is a follow-up: implement the `Planner` Protocol (one method, `plan(prompt) -> Plan`), inject via `RouterPipeline(planner=…)`. The Planner persona soul + instructionsText already lives in `personas/planner.json` and explicitly instructs the LLM to emit JSON matching the `Plan` shape — so the integration layer is small.

2. **No Fusion `fn task create` wiring.** The CLI prints decisions; it doesn't yet shell out to `fn`. Two reasons:
   - The 9 preset personas are UI-only in Fusion — they need to be materialized as rows in the `agents` table before `assignedAgentId` can reference them.
   - `assignedAgentId` expects Fusion's UUID, not the router's persona id. A `persona_id → fusion_agent_id` bridge needs to land before we plug in.
   Plan is below.

3. **No persistent decision log.** Every routing decision builds a `RoutingTrace` with `input_hash` + `trace[]` + `duration_ms`, but they're returned to the caller, not written to disk. Adding `~/.coywolf/router/log/decisions.jsonl` is a small follow-up; deferred so we can get the schema right with you in the morning.

4. **No automatic rule promotion from outcomes.** The self-improvement loop (mis-routing correction → new rule) is documented but not implemented. It's a v2.

## Wiring plan (for review)

To go from "router prints decisions" to "router creates Fusion tasks with the right persona":

### Step 1 — Materialize the 9 presets in Fusion's `agents` table

Currently the presets live in the client bundle (`AgentsView-*.js`). They need to exist as `agents` rows so `assignedAgentId` can point at them.

Mac-Mini-side script (sketch):
```python
import json, sqlite3, secrets
from datetime import datetime, timezone
DB = "/Users/coywolfden/coywolf/repos/lucid/.fusion/fusion.db"
NOW = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat().replace("+00:00", "Z")

PRESETS = {
  "qa-engineer": {
    "name": "QA Engineer",
    "role": "engineer",
    "soul": "# Soul: Quality Assurance Engineer\n…",  # full text from AgentsView bundle
    "instructionsText": "Always run the full test suite…",
  },
  # … rest of 9 …
}
conn = sqlite3.connect(DB)
for pid, spec in PRESETS.items():
    aid = "agent-" + secrets.token_hex(8)
    conn.execute(
      "INSERT OR IGNORE INTO agents (id, name, role, state, taskId, createdAt, updatedAt, metadata, data) VALUES (?, ?, ?, 'idle', NULL, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
      (aid, spec["name"], spec["role"], NOW, NOW, '{}',
       json.dumps({"id": aid, **spec})),
    )
conn.commit()
```

The trick: writing the `data` blob with the full soul + instructionsText so `hasAgentIdentity()` returns true — that's what makes the persona "real" enough for Pi to layer it into prompts.

### Step 2 — Build a `persona_id → fusion_agent_id` lookup

Either:
- **Tag-based:** add a `tag` column to `agents`, set `tag = 'qa-engineer'` on the QA agent record. Router resolves tag → id.
- **Convention-based:** store the Fusion `agent.id` *as* the persona id (`qa-engineer`, not a UUID). Skip the lookup entirely.

Convention-based is cleaner. Just use the persona id as the Fusion agent id when materializing in step 1.

### Step 3 — Add an `fn` shell-out from `cli.py`

Replace the print-only path with:
```python
subprocess.run([
  "fn", "-P", project_name, "task", "create", task.title,
  "--agent", decision.persona,
])
```
Add `--description`, `--type-hints`, etc. once we confirm `fn task create`'s flag surface.

### Step 4 — Wire 2touch's Slack listener to call `fnr` instead of bare `fn`

Currently the Slack flow in `app/server.js` directly INSERTs into `code_requests`. After step 3, it should:
1. Call `fnr task` (or `fnr mission`) with the prompt.
2. Read back the decisions.
3. Create one or more code_requests, each tagged with the chosen persona.

This is also where the **2touch Approval gate** stays — Brendan still approves before claude actually runs. The router just chooses *which persona's claude* runs.

## Open questions for the morning

1. **Scope of router:** does it apply only to Lucid (your personal Fusion projects) or also to 2touch (Pakt-team Slack flow)? My read is *both* — different rule files per project, same kernel. Confirm.
2. **Rule curation cadence:** how often do you want to review the rule diff? My instinct: rules live in this repo, PR-reviewed like code, no auto-merge of rule changes.
3. **The `__fallback__` LLM tie-break path** is wired but defaults to "generic engineer." When you want it to actually invoke an LLM, pass a `tiebreak_callback` to `RoutingFallback`. Want me to draft a `claude-haiku` callback or leave it pluggable?
4. **The Planner persona itself** lives in `personas/planner.json` with a complete soul + instructionsText. Read it (it's short) and tell me if the schema it commits to matches what you want from a real LLM planner. Tightening the schema makes the deterministic post-route stage more reliable.
